# databats

OSU CS340 group project  
Fall term 2023

### DESCRIPTION

In this project, we created a simple database for a bat rescue shelter. The shelterâ€™s purpose is to help injured and distressed bats, providing medical care (medication, surgery) and fostering. Each year, approximately 300 bats are admitted. About 70% survive and can be rehabilitated into the wild. A bat can stay anything between 1 and 90 days. There are no long-term patients. Each bat receives their own record with their basic information, as well as the circumstances and details of the person that found and submitted them. A daily care log per bat tracks their medical treatments and the name of the person that took care of them on the respective day.

**_TLDR_**: This database system aims to provide a reliable and structured platform for recording, monitoring, and managing the rehabilitation process of stranded bats. ðŸ§¡
