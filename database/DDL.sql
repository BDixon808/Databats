-- It should be possible to INSERT entries into every table individually.
-- Every table should be used in at least one SELECT query.
-- For the SELECT queries, it is fine to just display the content of the tables. 
-- It is generally not appropriate to have only a single query that joins all tables and displays them.
-- You need to include one DELETE and one UPDATE function in your website, for any one of the entities. 
-- In addition, it should be possible to add and remove things from at least one many-to-many relationship and it should be possible to add things to all relationships. 
-- This means you need SELECT & INSERT functionalities for all relationships as well as entities. And DELETE & UPDATE for least one m:m relationship.
-- Note that it's not acceptable to require the user to enter IDs for foreign keys. 
-- Instead your website needs to use a dynamically populated drop-down list or have the ability to search using text instead of entering in the ID. 
-- This Dynamic drop-down/Search functionality should be present for at least one entity. 
-- In one relationship, you should be able to set the foreign key value to NULL using UPDATE, that removes the relationship. 
-- In case none of the one-to-many relationships in your database has optional participation, you would need to change that to make sure one can have NULL values. 
-- For example, in the table Orders, there may be two FKs: the employeeID and the customerID which create relations to the Employees and Customers tables. 
-- It may not be sensible for the Customer to be optional. But the Employee could be optional. 
-- Thus, we would expect that in the Orders INSERT and UPDATE pages it is possible to set the employeeID to a value or else to NULL. 
-- You should be able to DELETE a record from a M:M relationship without creating a data anomaly in the related tables. 
-- For example, DELETEing a Customer should handle any Orders that were made by the Customer. 
-- This can be done by either by setting the CustomerID to NULL, or else by DELETEing any Order(s) associated with that Customer. 
-- More on how this can be done in Week 5 when we cover MySQL CASCADELinks to an external site.. 
-- To continue the example from above, if you have 5 tables in your schema, then at a minimum, 
-- we expect you to implement 5 SELECTs, 5 INSERTs, 1 UPDATE (1 NULLable relationship), 1 DELETE (M:M), and 1 Dynamic drop-down/Search for a total of 14 functions.
