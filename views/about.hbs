      <h2>Okay, but what is this all about anyway?</h2>
      </p>
      <p>In this project for CS 340 of Oregon State University, we created a simple database for a fictitious bat rescue
        shelter. The shelterâ€™s purpose is to help
        injured and distressed bats, providing medical care (medication, surgery) and fostering. It is loosely based on
        an actual bat rescue station located in Zurich,
        Switzerland. Each year, approximately 300 bats are admitted. About 70% survive and can
        be rehabilitated into the wild. A bat can stay anything between 1 and 90 days. There are no long-term patients.
        Each bat receives their
        own record with their basic information, as well as the circumstances and details of the person that found and
        submitted them. A daily
        care log per bat tracks their medical treatments and the name of the person that took care of them on the
        respective day.</p>
